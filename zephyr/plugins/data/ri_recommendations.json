{"BestPracticeChecks":[{"CheckId":190,"Name":"EC2 Reserved Instance Purchase Recommendations","ShortDescription":"Checks to see if you could benefit by purchasing EC2 Reserved Instances.","LongDescription":"<p>Reserved instances offer a greatly reduced hourly rate in exchange for a one-time, up-front fee as well as a one or three year commitment.  Once a reserved instance is purchased, and the up-front fee paid, a user must launch an On-Demand EC2 instance that matches all of the criteria of the Reserved purchase to be billed at the reduced price.  This criteria includes the region of the instance, as well as the instance platform, type, and Availability Zone.</p><p>CloudCheckr makes Reserved Instance purchase recommendations based on the EC2 usage trends within your account.  Purchase recommendations are made when the cost of running the EC2 instances (including the upfront fees) at reserved pricing is less than running those same instances On-Demand.</p><p>Go here to learn more: <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/reserved-instances\" target=\"_blank\">http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/reserved-instances</a></p>","Category":"Cost","Importance":"Medium","CountOfResults":8,"Results":["Number: 1 | Instance Type: t2.micro | AZ: us-west-2b | Platform: LinuxVpc | Commitment Type: 1 Year Partial Upfront | Tenancy: Default | Upfront RI Cost: $51.00 | Reserved Monthly Cost: $2.16 | On-Demand Monthly Cost: $9.09 | Total Savings: $31.86","Number: 4 | Instance Type: t2.micro | AZ: us-west-2c | Platform: LinuxVpc | Commitment Type: 1 Year Partial Upfront | Tenancy: Default | Upfront RI Cost: $204.00 | Reserved Monthly Cost: $8.64 | On-Demand Monthly Cost: $36.35 | Total Savings: $127.10","Number: 5 | Instance Type: m3.medium | AZ: us-west-2a | Platform: LinuxVpc | Commitment Type: 1 Year Partial Upfront | Tenancy: Default | Upfront RI Cost: $1,055.00 | Reserved Monthly Cost: $61.20 | On-Demand Monthly Cost: $234.22 | Total Savings: $1,011.09","Number: 2 | Instance Type: t2.medium | AZ: us-west-2a | Platform: LinuxVpc | Commitment Type: 1 Year Partial Upfront | Tenancy: Default | Upfront RI Cost: $408.00 | Reserved Monthly Cost: $17.28 | On-Demand Monthly Cost: $72.76 | Total Savings: $254.84","Number: 1 | Instance Type: m4.large | AZ: us-west-2a | Platform: LinuxVpc | Commitment Type: 1 Year Partial Upfront | Tenancy: Default | Upfront RI Cost: $324.00 | Reserved Monthly Cost: $26.64 | On-Demand Monthly Cost: $88.15 | Total Savings: $409.65","Number: 1 | Instance Type: m4.large | AZ: us-west-2c | Platform: LinuxVpc | Commitment Type: 1 Year Partial Upfront | Tenancy: Default | Upfront RI Cost: $324.00 | Reserved Monthly Cost: $26.64 | On-Demand Monthly Cost: $88.15 | Total Savings: $409.65","Number: 2 | Instance Type: m3.medium | AZ: us-west-2b | Platform: LinuxVpc | Commitment Type: 1 Year Partial Upfront | Tenancy: Default | Upfront RI Cost: $422.00 | Reserved Monthly Cost: $24.48 | On-Demand Monthly Cost: $93.74 | Total Savings: $405.09","Number: 3 | Instance Type: m3.medium | AZ: us-west-2c | Platform: LinuxVpc | Commitment Type: 1 Year Partial Upfront | Tenancy: Default | Upfront RI Cost: $633.00 | Reserved Monthly Cost: $36.72 | On-Demand Monthly Cost: $140.48 | Total Savings: $606.00"]}],"DateOfResults":"2016-01-01T14:49:02"}
