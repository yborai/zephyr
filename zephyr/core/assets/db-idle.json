[{"BestPracticeChecks": [{"LongDescription": "<p>The Relational Database Service (RDS) provides access to the capabilities of MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server database engines while taking care of much of the administrative tasks associated with each. Patches to the databases, as well as backups, are all handled automatically by AWS.</p><p>Idle DB instances are detected by looking at their CloudWatch data over the last 48 hours and analyzing its CPU Utilization. If the number of write and read IOPS is less than 20, the DB instance is flagged as idle. You should contact the owner of the DB instance and verify if it is needed. If the DB instance is needed, you can ignore this check so it does not continue to be flagged.</p><p>Go here to learn more:<br><a href=\"http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/CW_Support_For_AWS.html#rds-metricscollected\" target=\"_blank\">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/CW_Support_For_AWS.html#rds-metricscollected</a></p>", "ShortDescription": "Attempt to detect any RDS DB Instances that appear to be idle.", "Category": "Cost", "Importance": "High", "Name": "Idle RDS DB Instances", "Results": ["DB Instance: prpgbtrpt | Average Read IOPS: 0.34 | Average Write IOPS: 1.40 | Predicted Monthly Cost: $136.80 | Region: US East (Northern Virginia)"], "CheckId": 134, "CountOfResults": 1}], "DateOfResults": "2017-01-01T23:49:28"}]
